The project I am working on is a tool for helping IoT device creators manage their over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates. Once a creator has delivered a hardware product to a customer it is likely to require firmware updates. A common method of deploying these updates is via a wireless protocol such as WiFi or Bluetooth. Creators need a place to manage these firmware updates and decide how and when to deploy them. This can include things like ringed-deployment and targeting certain custom firmware to specific device groups. Additionally, it is helpful to know how many devices are running a specific version of firmware as well as some information about those devices.

The central purpose of this service is to provide an easy and intuitive way to upload firmware binaries and schedule them for deployment to devices. The image I want to convey is a strong technical look that is mature and trustworthy but also has a bit of a maker-friendly vibe.

For right now local dummy data or mockups should be used to simulate data. No live API calls are needed.

I would prefer Typescript be used but this is not a hard requirement. If youâ€™re more comfortable with vanilla JS then please use that.

The deliverable will be an SPA build package (simple quasar build) of your work that I can open and navigate.

Attached are the specs. Please let me know if you have any questions.
